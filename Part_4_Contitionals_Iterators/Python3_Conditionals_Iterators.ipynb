Important building blocks of any programming language are `if` conditions as well as `while` and `for` loops, which considerably influence the control flow. In this lecture we will cover these concepts together with list comprehensions, `break` and `continue` statements and some basic syntax that is helpful for things like boolean expressions and the `range()` function."

You can also test if a number/variable is smaller/larger than anything else with `<`,`>`, `<=` and `>=`. If you want to check if a certain element is in a list/tuple/set, you can use `in`. These operators can be connected by `and` and `or`, respectively. As a result you will always get a boolean (`True` or `False`) for all of those operators. `if` and `while` statements will always be executed if the expression's result is `True` and not executed if the expression's result is `False`."
