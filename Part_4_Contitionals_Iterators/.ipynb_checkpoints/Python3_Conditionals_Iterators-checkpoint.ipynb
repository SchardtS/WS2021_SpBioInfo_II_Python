    "Often you want to execute some code only if certain conditions hold or execute different statements depending on several mutually exclusive conditions. In Python the compound statement if is used for this purpose. It uses `if`, `elif` (wich is short for 'else if'), and `else` clauses to make you able to conditionally execute blocks of statements.  `if` statements will always be executed if the expression's result is `True` and not executed if the expression's result is `False`. The basic syntax with optional `elif` and `else` clauses is:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if conditional expression1:\n",

Similarly, `elif` statements only get tested if no other conditional statement before was evaluated as `True`. You can use as many `elif` statements as you want, whereas only one else clause is possible."
