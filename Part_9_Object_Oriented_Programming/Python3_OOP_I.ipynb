    "Until now, you have learned to create various different data types and to write your own functions that you can use individually in your code - this is called a procedural programming approach. As your programs become longer and more complex, it will become important to organize the code by what is called object-oriented programming. This implies arrangement of datastructures and asscoiated operations into subgroups. A modular code structure helps to prevent functional recurrences and to increase both consistancy of data and the reuseability of the code.  "
